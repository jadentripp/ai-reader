# Product Guidelines

## Visual Identity
*   **Aesthetic:** "Classic Academic." A balance between the warmth of a traditional library and the crispness of modern software.
*   **Typography:**
    *   **Body Text:** High-readability serif fonts (e.g., Merriweather, EB Garamond) for long-form reading.
    *   **UI Elements:** Clean sans-serif fonts (e.g., Inter, system-ui) for navigation and controls.
*   **Color Palette:**
    *   **Light Mode:** Off-white/cream backgrounds with dark gray text (softer than stark black on white).
    *   **Dark Mode:** Deep slate or charcoal backgrounds with light gray text.
    *   **Accent:** Muted gold or deep crimson to evoke a "classic book" feel without being distracting.

## User Experience (UX) Principles
*   **Content First:** The reading pane is the protagonist. UI controls (menus, settings) should recede or hide when not in use.
*   **Distraction-Free:** Animations should be subtle and functional (e.g., smooth page turns), avoiding flashy transitions that break concentration.
*   **Accessibility:** Support scalable font sizes and high-contrast modes. Keyboard navigation for page turning is essential.

## Tone & Voice
*   **Professional & reverence:** The app treats the text with respect. Error messages and prompts should be polite and clear, avoiding overly casual slang.
